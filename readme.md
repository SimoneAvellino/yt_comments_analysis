### ðŸ“Œ Work Division

To ensure an efficient and collaborative workflow, the project is divided into the following main areas:

#### 1. **Data Preprocessing & Exploration**
- Cleaning and standardizing text data (removing stopwords, emojis, URLs, etc.)
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA) on comment metadata (likes, replies, timestamps)
- Visualization of comment frequency, length, and engagement metrics  

#### 2. **Sentiment Analysis**
- Apply sentiment analysis models (e.g., VADER, TextBlob, or transformer-based models)
- Visualize sentiment trends across different topics or timeframes
- Correlate sentiment with engagement (likes, replies)

#### 3. **Topic Modeling**
- Use NLP methods like LDA, BERTopic, or clustering for topic discovery
- Summarize and visualize key topics in the comment sections
- Identify changes in topic focus over time or across videos

#### 4. **Toxicity & Spam Detection**
- Build classification models to flag toxic or spammy comments
- Use pretrained models (e.g., Googleâ€™s Perspective API, Detoxify)
- Evaluate performance and suggest moderation strategies

#### 5. **Reporting & Dashboard (Optional)**
- Create an interactive dashboard for exploring insights (e.g., using Streamlit or Dash)
- Compile findings into a well-documented report or presentation
